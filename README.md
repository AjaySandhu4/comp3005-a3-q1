1. Setup the database: run "python3 loader.py" (or however else you run python3 on your system).
2. Run the application: run "python3 app.py" (after having run the loader.py file). 

Notes:
- loader.py and application.py run under assumption there is a postgres server running on localhost on port 5432.
- You may need to install some dependencies (eg. psycopg) by for example using pip.
